# TODOS
- [x] Split steps to 3/4 different forms -> they will be a part of a one form, but schemas are going to be separate
- [x] put it in a satepper -> maybe skip
- [ ] Make dynamic schema for machine detail step, to validate against fetched concurrent plans -- almost done I think
    - Almost done
- [ ] Make an endpoint that will take in the interval user wanted to take and will return the closest free time to that one which is of the same length
- [ ] Fix error messages on time selection in the configure machine step
- [ ] Do the TODOS in the backend code
- [ ] Consider opting for what you wrote to work obsidian
